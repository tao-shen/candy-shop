## What is Candy Shop?

Candy Shop is an open-source marketplace for **AI agent skills** — reusable prompt instructions (defined in `SKILL.md` files) that give AI agents like Claude Code specialized capabilities. Think of it as an app store, but for AI skills.

- **230+ curated skills** across 8 categories
- **Run skills instantly** in the built-in agent executor
- **Create your own skills** with a visual editor
- **Community-driven** — contribute skills via GitHub PRs

## Features

### Skill Marketplace
Browse and search a curated collection of AI skills organized into categories: Development, Design, Tools, Marketing, Mobile, Productivity, Research, and Writing.

### Built-in Skill Executor
Run any skill directly in the browser with a full-featured chat interface powered by [OpenCode](https://github.com/nichochar/opencode). Supports streaming responses, file attachments, tool use, and interactive Q&A.

### Skill Creator
Build and publish your own skills with a name, description, system prompt, and configuration — no coding required.
